# BlindRunner

**BlindRunner App** is a Flutter application designed to assist blind users by providing vital information using text-to-speech (TTS) and location-based services. The app helps users navigate and provides important alerts based on location and device data.

- **Nearby Facilities**: Fetches nearby sports facilities based on the user's location.
- **Serial Communication**: Reads serial data for distance and heart rate from a connected USB device.
- **Alert**: Alert when an obstacle is detected within 3 meters
- **Gesture-Based Interaction**:
  - **Single Tap**: Announces the current location.
  - **Double Tap**: Fetches and announces the nearest sports facility.
  - **Long Press**: Announces the heart rate condition in real-time
